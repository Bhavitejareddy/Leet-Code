1368. Minimum Cost to Make at Least One Valid Path in a Grid

Given an m x n grid. Each cell of the grid has a sign pointing to the next cell you should visit if you are currently in this cell. The sign of grid[i][j] can be:

1 which means go to the cell to the right. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i][j + 1])
2 which means go to the cell to the left. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i][j - 1])
3 which means go to the lower cell. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i + 1][j])
4 which means go to the upper cell. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i - 1][j])
Notice that there could be some signs on the cells of the grid that point outside the grid.

You will initially start at the upper left cell (0, 0). A valid path in the grid is a path that starts from the upper left cell (0, 0) and ends at the bottom-right cell (m - 1, n - 1) following the signs on the grid. The valid path does not have to be the shortest.

You can modify the sign on a cell with cost = 1. You can modify the sign on a cell one time only.

Return the minimum cost to make the grid have at least one valid path.

Code:
class Solution {
  public int minCost(int[][] grid) {
    final int m = grid.length;
    final int n = grid[0].length;
    int[][] mem = new int[m][n];
    Arrays.stream(mem).forEach(A -> Arrays.fill(A, -1));
    Queue<Pair<Integer, Integer>> q = new ArrayDeque<>();

    dfs(grid, 0, 0, /*cost=*/0, q, mem);

    for (int cost = 1; !q.isEmpty(); ++cost)
      for (int sz = q.size(); sz > 0; --sz) {
        Pair<Integer, Integer> pair = q.poll();
        final int i = pair.getKey();
        final int j = pair.getValue();
        for (int[] dir : dirs)
          dfs(grid, i + dir[0], j + dir[1], cost, q, mem);
      }

    return mem[m - 1][n - 1];
  }

  private static final int[][] dirs = {{0, 1}, {0, -1}, {1, 0}, {-1, 0}};

  private void dfs(int[][] grid, int i, int j, int cost, Queue<Pair<Integer, Integer>> q,
                   int[][] mem) {
    if (i < 0 || i == grid.length || j < 0 || j == grid[0].length)
      return;
    if (mem[i][j] != -1)
      return;

    mem[i][j] = cost;
    q.add(new Pair<>(i, j));
    int[] dir = dirs[grid[i][j] - 1];
    dfs(grid, i + dir[0], j + dir[1], cost, q, mem);
  }
