1462. Course Schedule IV

There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course ai first if you want to take course bi.

For example, the pair [0, 1] indicates that you have to take course 0 before you can take course 1.
Prerequisites can also be indirect. If course a is a prerequisite of course b, and course b is a prerequisite of course c, then course a is a prerequisite of course c.

You are also given an array queries where queries[j] = [uj, vj]. For the jth query, you should answer whether course uj is a prerequisite of course vj or not.

Return a boolean array answer, where answer[j] is the answer to the jth query.

Code:
class Solution {
    public List<Boolean> checkIfPrerequisite(int n, int[][] prerequisites, int[][] queries) {
        boolean[][] f = new boolean[n][n];
        for (var p : prerequisites) {
            f[p[0]][p[1]] = true;
        }
        for (int k = 0; k < n; ++k) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
                for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                    f[i][j] |= f[i][k] && f[k][j];
                }
            }
        }
        List<Boolean> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        for (var q : queries) {
            ans.add(f[q[0]][q[1]]);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
