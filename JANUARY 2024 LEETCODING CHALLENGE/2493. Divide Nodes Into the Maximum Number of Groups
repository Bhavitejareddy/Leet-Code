2493. Divide Nodes Into the Maximum Number of Groups

You are given a positive integer n representing the number of nodes in an undirected graph. The nodes are labeled from 1 to n.

You are also given a 2D integer array edges, where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is a bidirectional edge between nodes ai and bi. 
Notice that the given graph may be disconnected.

Divide the nodes of the graph into m groups (1-indexed) such that:

Each node in the graph belongs to exactly one group.
For every pair of nodes in the graph that are connected by an edge [ai, bi], if ai belongs to the group with index x, and bi belongs to the group with index y, then |y - x| = 1.
Return the maximum number of groups (i.e., maximum m) into which you can divide the nodes. Return -1 if it is impossible to group the nodes with the given conditions.

Code:

class Solution {
    public int magnificentSets(int n, int[][] edges) {
        List<Integer>[] g = new List[n];
        Arrays.setAll(g, k -> new ArrayList<>());
        for (var e : edges) {
            int a = e[0] - 1, b = e[1] - 1;
            g[a].add(b);
            g[b].add(a);
        }
        int[] d = new int[n];
        int[] dist = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            Deque<Integer> q = new ArrayDeque<>();
            q.offer(i);
            Arrays.fill(dist, 0);
            dist[i] = 1;
            int mx = 1;
            int root = i;
            while (!q.isEmpty()) {
                int a = q.poll();
                root = Math.min(root, a);
                for (int b : g[a]) {
                    if (dist[b] == 0) {
                        dist[b] = dist[a] + 1;
                        mx = Math.max(mx, dist[b]);
                        q.offer(b);
                    } else if (Math.abs(dist[b] - dist[a]) != 1) {
                        return -1;
                    }
                }
            }
            d[root] = Math.max(d[root], mx);
        }
        return Arrays.stream(d).sum();
    }
}
