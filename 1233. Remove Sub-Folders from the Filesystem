1233. Remove Sub-Folders from the Filesystem

Given a list of folders folder, return the folders after removing all sub-folders in those folders. You may return the answer in any order.

If a folder[i] is located within another folder[j], it is called a sub-folder of it. A sub-folder of folder[j] must start with folder[j], followed by a "/". For example, "/a/b" is a sub-folder of "/a", but "/b" is not a sub-folder of "/a/b/c".

The format of a path is one or more concatenated strings of the form: '/' followed by one or more lowercase English letters.

For example, "/leetcode" and "/leetcode/problems" are valid paths while an empty string and "/" are not.

Code:

class Solution {
  public List<String> removeSubfolders(String[] folder) {
    List<String> ans = new ArrayList<>();
    String prev = "";

    Arrays.sort(folder);

    for (final String f : folder) {
      if (!prev.isEmpty() && f.startsWith(prev) && f.charAt(prev.length()) == '/')
        continue;
      ans.add(f);
      prev = f;
    }

    return ans;
  }
}
