796. Rotate String

Given two strings s and goal, return true if and only if s can become goal after some number of shifts on s.

A shift on s consists of moving the leftmost character of s to the rightmost position.

For example, if s = "abcde", then it will be "bcdea" after one shift.

Code:

class Solution {
    public boolean rotateString(String s, String goal) {
        if (s.length() != goal.length()) {
            return false;
        }

        String s_concat = s + s;
        return s_concat.contains(goal);
    }
}

Time Complexity:
O(N), where N is the length of the strings s and goal.

Space Complexity:
O(N), for the concatenated string s_concat.
