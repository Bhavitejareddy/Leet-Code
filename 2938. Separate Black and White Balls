2938. Separate Black and White Balls

There are n balls on a table, each ball has a color black or white.

You are given a 0-indexed binary string s of length n, where 1 and 0 represent black and white balls, respectively.

In each step, you can choose two adjacent balls and swap them.

Return the minimum number of steps to group all the black balls to the right and all the white balls to the left.



Code: 
class Solution {
  public long minimumSteps(String s) {
    long ans = 0;
    int ones = 0;

    for (final char c : s.toCharArray())
      if (c == '1')
        ++ones;
      else // Move 1s to the front of the current '0'.
        ans += ones;

    return ans;
  }
}

The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string.
The space complexity is O(1).
