2825. Make String a Subsequence Using Cyclic Increments

You are given two 0-indexed strings str1 and str2.

In an operation, you select a set of indices in str1, and for each index i in the set, increment str1[i] to the next character cyclically.
That is 'a' becomes 'b', 'b' becomes 'c', and so on, and 'z' becomes 'a'.

Return true if it is possible to make str2 a subsequence of str1 by performing the operation at most once, and false otherwise.

Note: A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (possibly none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.

Code:

class Solution {
  public boolean canMakeSubsequence(String str1, String str2) {
    int i = 0; // str2's index

    for (final char c : str1.toCharArray())
      if (c == str2.charAt(i) || ('a' + ((c - 'a' + 1) % 26)) == str2.charAt(i))
        if (++i == str2.length())
          return true;

    return false;
  }
}
