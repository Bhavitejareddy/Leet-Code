2466. Count Ways To Build Good Strings

Given the integers zero, one, low, and high, we can construct a string by starting with an empty string, and then at each step perform either of the following:

Append the character '0' zero times.
Append the character '1' one times.
This can be performed any number of times.

A good string is a string constructed by the above process having a length between low and high (inclusive).

Return the number of different good strings that can be constructed satisfying these properties. Since the answer can be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Code:
class Solution {
  public int countGoodStrings(int low, int high, int zero, int one) {
    final int kMod = 1_000_000_007;
    int ans = 0;
    // dp[i] := the number of good strings with length i
    int[] dp = new int[high + 1];
    dp[0] = 1;

    for (int i = 1; i <= high; ++i) {
      if (i >= zero)
        dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - zero]) % kMod;
      if (i >= one)
        dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - one]) % kMod;
      if (i >= low)
        ans = (ans + dp[i]) % kMod;
    }

    return ans;
  }
}
