# LeetCode Daily Challenges 🚀

Welcome to my **LeetCode Daily Challenge** repository! This repo contains my daily solutions to various LeetCode problems. Through consistent problem-solving, I aim to improve my algorithmic thinking, coding skills, and understanding of data structures.

## Structure 🗂️

Each problem is stored in a text file, named with the problem number and title (e.g., `001.Two_Sum`). Inside each folder, you'll find:
- The problem statement.
- My solution in Java .
- Comments explaining the approach and time/space complexity.

## Goals 🎯
- **Consistency**: Solve at least one problem daily.
- **Optimization**: Focus on improving the efficiency of the code.
- **Learning**: Gain deeper insights into different types of algorithms and data structures.
- **Sharing**: Provide clear, well-documented code to help others learn.

## Topics Covered 📝
- Arrays & Strings
- Linked Lists
- Trees & Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Sorting & Searching
- And more...

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/leetcode-daily-challenges.git
2. Navigate to the folder of the topic/problem you're interested in.
3. Review the code and problem statement for detailed solutions.
