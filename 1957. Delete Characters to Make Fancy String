1957. Delete Characters to Make Fancy String

A fancy string is a string where no three consecutive characters are equal.

Given a string s, delete the minimum possible number of characters from s to make it fancy.

Return the final string after the deletion. It can be shown that the answer will always be unique.

Code : 

class Solution {
  public String makeFancyString(String s) {
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    for (char c : s.toCharArray())
      if (sb.length() < 2 || //
          sb.charAt(sb.length() - 1) != c || sb.charAt(sb.length() - 2) != c)
        sb.append(c);
    return sb.toString();
  }
}

The time complexity is O(n), and the space complexity is O(n). Here, n is the length of the string $s$.
